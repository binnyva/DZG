# Connections in People Groups

- Bonding Social capital: The number of connections within a group.
- Bridging Social Capital: The number of connections between groups.

Too much bonding social capital and it will create group think that will not take in ideas from outside. Too little and ideas will not be shared between members.

Ideal mix of bonding and Bridging is called a small world network.

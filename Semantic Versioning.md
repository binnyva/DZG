# Semantic Versioning

With semantic versioning, every version number is of the form: major.minor.patch. Rules...
- If a new release does not change the API, increase the patch version.
- If you add to your API in a backwards-compatible way, increase the minor version.
- If you change the API in a non-backwards-compatible way, increase the major version.

# Rules of Risk

# Rules of Risk

1. Voluntary risk is way more acceptable than involuntary risk
2. Acceptance of risk is inversely proportional to prevalence.
3. Disease in a yardstick.
4. Novelty increases perceived risk(less you know about something, the more riskier you think it is).
5. Numbers are numbing(mass casualty events are acceptable)

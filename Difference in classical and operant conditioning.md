Learning in psychology is clasical or operant conditioning. Its a change in behaviour depending on the envionment.

## Classical Conditioning

Pavlo's dog experiment was Classical conditioning. Conditional Stimulas(Bell) comes before the change in action.

## Opernant Conditioning

Consequences lead to change in voluntary behavior

### Reinforcement

Eg. Giving a child candy for doing something good. Conditioning is after the action.

### Punishment

Eg. Beating a child for doing something wrong.

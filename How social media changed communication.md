## Older Media

- TV
- Radio
- Newspapers/publications

All were one way channels.

## New Media
- Email
- Facebook
- Twitter
Two way comms

Mobile took it further - increased the speed of communications.

You can react way faster to stories - because you are listening more.

This required new competencies to be build
- Managing Word of Mouth 
- Reputation Management
- Community Management
- Influence Management

E-Crisis Management - they spread way faster.

Comms have changed in these ways
- Centeralized -> De-Centralized
- Formal -> Social
